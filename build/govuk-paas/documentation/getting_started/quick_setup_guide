<h3 id="setting-up-the-command-line">Setting up the command line</h3>

<p>Government PaaS uses a hosting technology called Cloud Foundry. As a tenant (that is, someone who is hosting an application on the PaaS), you will use the Cloud Foundry command line client to interact with the PaaS. To set it up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads" target="blank">Cloud Foundry CLI for your platform </a> [external page, opens in new tab]</li>
<li><p>To check that it installed correctly, go to the Terminal/command line/Command Prompt and run:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf -v
</code></pre>

<p>You should get a message like this, confirming the version that&rsquo;s installed (it may not be this exact version):</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf version 6.18.1+a1103f0-2016-05-24
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> depending on your network configuration you might need to <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html">set an <code class="prettyprint">HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable</a> for the CLI to connect. Contact your network administrators to work out the correct settings for your configuration.  </p></li>
<li><p>Log in by running:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code class="prettyprint">USERNAME</code> is your email address your account was created with.</p>

<p>You will then be prompted to enter your password, which should have been sent to you by email (subject &ldquo;Welcome to the Government PaaS&rdquo;).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s important for security that you now change your password</strong>. Run:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">cf passwd</code></p>

<p>You will be prompted to enter your password from the previous step. You can then choose a new password.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once logged in, you can see the available commands by running <code class="prettyprint">cf</code>.</p>
