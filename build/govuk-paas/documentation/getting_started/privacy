<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Government Platform as a Service (PaaS) is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), which is part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office">Cabinet Office</a>. We use your personal data to provide you with access to PaaS systems, and to administer that access.</p>

<p>This privacy policy explains the kinds of data that we process, how it’s used, how it’s stored, how it’s protected and how you can find out about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-we-process">The data we process</h3>

<ul>
<li>your name - so we know who is using the account</li>
<li>your email address - which allows us to contact you about your account</li>

</ul>

<p>We use this information to create and administer user accounts with our platform.</p>

<p>We don’t share this information with anyone else.</p>

<p>We will store the data you provide in order for your user account with PaaS to function correctly, and so we can administer that access - including sending you updates and notices.</p>

<p>We will delete your personal data when your user account is no longer required. We keep records of the user account activity for up to an additional 2 years.</p>

<h3 id="where-we-store-your-data">Where we store your data</h3>

<p>We store your data on our servers in the European Union. We’ll never transfer or your data on servers outside of the European Economic Area.</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting the information you provide. We ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent the disclosure, theft or unauthorised modification of your information.
